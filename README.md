# BSS by using INFOMAX algorithm with Python.

## Blind source separation using Infomax__FastICA 
An example of estimating sources from noisy data.

ICA is used to estimate sources given noisy measurements. Imagine 3 instruments playing simultaneously and 3 microphones recording the mixed signals. ICA is used to recover the sources ie. what is played by each instrument. 
PS: PCA fails at recovering our instruments since the related signals reflect non-Gaussian processes.
